he Cofoundry *User Area* feature can be used to build a member-only area of your site or to deliver enhanced experiences for your signed-up users. Once a [User Area has been defined](/content-management/user-areas/defining-a-user-area) you will get access to a separate user management area of the admin panel as well as a set of data APIs to help you query and manage your users.

User areas are built on the same underlying framework that powers the admin panel, so you can benefit from the same level of security and features such as roles, permissions, password recovery and auditing. However custom user areas are defined and partitioned separately and therefore offer a high degree of isolated customization.
