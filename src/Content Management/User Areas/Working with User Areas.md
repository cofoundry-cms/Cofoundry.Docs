Cofoundry provides a number of ways to work with your user data, but it's up to you to log users in and manage the ways they interact with your site.

*We'll be adding more thorough documentation at a later date, but for now the [SPASite](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/Cofoundry.Samples.SPASite) sample is a good example of working with a custom User Area.*
